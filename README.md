[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-dja6gj)

This a small project in Angular that covers a lot of key concepts
I have tried to cover here

1. Basics of authentication
2. Component to component interaction (with @input)
3. Pipes
4. Services
5. ngFor preDefined directive
6. implemented 2 way binding without ngModel
7. Concepts of ng-template , ng-container , ng-template
8. hierarchy of service
9. Basics of services

This is an humble attempt to showcase some basic concepts in angular . If there is some problem in understanding the code flow , let me know . I will update this Readme file with proper explainations of the concepts and the code flow .

I hope this project helps someone in some way .

Happy coding
